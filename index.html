            <h1>Some dad jokes.</h1>
            Alright, buckle up for some certified dad-grade humor:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! I mean, they're always fabricating stories, those little guys. It's hard to get a straight answer out of them, especially when you ask about the strong nuclear force. They just give you a quarky look and say, "It's complicated."
                </li>
                <li>
                    I used to hate facial hair... but then it grew on me. Like, literally grew. I started with a little stubble, then a goatee, and now I'm practically a wizard. My wife says I look distinguished, but I think she's just afraid I'll use my beard to cast spells on her. Which, by the way, I totally could. I've been practicing my "Abracadabra-shave" spell, but it's still a work in progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What do you call a fish with no eyes? Fsh! It's a classic, I know, but it's a goodie. It's like, they're swimming along, minding their own business, and then... darkness. They're just floundering around, lost in the sea of possibilities. Makes you think, doesn't it? About the importance of vision, and how we should all appreciate the little things, like being able to see where we're going.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She seemed surprised. I mean, they were practically touching her hairline! It was like she was perpetually astonished by everything. "Honey," I said, "You look like you just saw a ghost... a really hairy ghost." She rolled her eyes, but I think she secretly appreciated the feedback. Or at least, she stopped drawing them so high.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do you organize a space party? You planet! You know, get all the celestial bodies together, have some cosmic snacks, maybe a little asteroid bowling. It's a blast! And the best part is, the music is out of this world. Especially when you get the solar system's top DJ, DJ Comet, to spin some tunes. He really knows how to get the planets grooving.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down! I mean, I tried to set it on the table, but it just floated there, defying all laws of physics. It's like the book is saying, "No, you must keep reading! You must know the secrets of the universe!" And I'm like, "Okay, okay, I'll finish the chapter." But then I get to the end, and it's like, "Nope, you're not done yet." It's a real page-turner, in more ways than one.
